NOTES
This script makes a few decisions about what exactly a best hit to both a polypeptide and a gene are. Regarding
polypeptides, since it is possible for there to be multiple hits to different segments of the sequence, the "best" is
taken as the one with the lowest E-value and all others are ignored. Since the quality of the resulting orthologous
group is likely better assessed by aligning the sequences anyway, these secondary hits are not of high importance.
Regarding genes, a strict adherence to the top hit criterion would allow only polypeptide per gene. This can create
mutually exclusive sets of polypeptide hits within a single orthologous group, a more flexible strategy is allowing
multiple best hits within a gene. The most natural extension of the polypeptide criterion is choosing top hits ranked by
evalue until the parent gene of the polypeptide changes. Subsequent hits to the top gene are considered ambiguous and
ignored (similar to how subsequent hits to a polypeptide are ignored in the polypeptide case). This criterion will
exclude some polypeptides that are associated with the best gene, but since these are ranked lower than hits to
polypeptides in other genes, they should not be included since other stronger hits are discarded.
