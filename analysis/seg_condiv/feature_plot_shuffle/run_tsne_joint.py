NOTES
No differences between shuffled and observed sequences for the all, len, net_charge, norm, or znorm feature sets
In the len+net_charge feature set, the shuffled sequences form clusters that are less diffuse and more punctate
    The conserved and diverged sequences still cluster, but the clusters more a mosaic of subclusters of conserved or diverged than a mixture of the sequences
    This effect is subtle, however, and largely only apparent at moderate perplexities
